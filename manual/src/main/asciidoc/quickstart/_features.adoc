== Optional features

Everything discussed in the quickstart guide so far is installed out-of-the-box in Apache ServiceMix, but we also have a lot of
optional features that can be installed in the container when necessary.

=== List of features

The list of features is available with the _feature:list_ command.  The overview shows you whether or not the feature is currently
installed, the version and the name of the feature.

The full list contains a lot of different features: optional Camel components, features for adding OBR or wrapper support to
ServiceMix, a web console, and many more.  Again, you can use things like _|_ and _grep_ to find the things in the list that you're
interested in.

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:list | grep camel
----

=== Example: web console

To get the web console installed in ServiceMix, install the feature from your console
[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:install webconsole
----

Afterwards, you can verify that the feature is installed and started in the overview.

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:list | grep -i webconsole
----

You will now be able to point your browser to http://localhost:8181/system/console and login with user _smx_ and password _smx_ to
access the web console.  From the webconsole, Karaf can be managed, including starting and stopping bundles, installing and
uninstalling features, and managing the configuration.
