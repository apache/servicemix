== Installation

Before we can start working with Apache ServiceMix, we have to get it installed and running on our local machine first.

=== System requirements

For running Apache ServiceMix itself, you'll need

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7.x (Java 7) or
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8.x (Java 8)
* About 100 MB of free disk space for the default assembly

If you're developing your own integration applications and OSGi bundles, you'll also need

* Java Developer Kit (JDK) 1.7.x (Java 7) or
  Java Developer Kit (JDK) 1.8.x (Java 8)
* Apache Maven 3.0.4 or higher

=== Downloading Apache ServiceMix

Apache ServiceMix {servicemix-version} is available under the Apache License v2 and can be downloaded from http://servicemix.apache.org/downloads.html.

Depending on your operation system, you should download either the tar.gz or the zip file:

* _tar.gz_ for Linux/Unix/MacOS X
* _zip_ for Windows

=== Installing Apache ServiceMix

Installing Apache ServiceMix is as simple as uncompressing the downloaded archive on your hard disk.  For the rest of this guide, we'll refer to the this location as *_<SERVICEMIX_HOME>_*.

=== Starting Apache ServiceMix

Depending on your platform, start Apache ServiceMix by following the instructions below.  After starting the container, you will have access to the console from which you can manage the container.

==== On Windows
In a command prompt window, navigate to the directory where you extracted ServiceMix and run the _bin\servicemix.bat_ file.
