== Introduction

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that unifies the features and functionality of
Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and Karaf into a powerful runtime platform for building integrations solutions.

The goal of this document is to introduce you to the different components that are part of Apache ServiceMix and explain
