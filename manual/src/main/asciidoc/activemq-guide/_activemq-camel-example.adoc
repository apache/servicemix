== Using ActiveMQ with Camel

This sections is based on the activemq-camel-blueprint example in the ServiceMix distribution.

=== Objectives 

The objectives of this sections are to explain how to

* define Camel routes as an OSGi bundle using Blueprint,   
* publish messages to an ActiveMQ queue,
* consume messages from an ActiveMQ queue,
* build and install the OSGi bundle,
* write messages to the log.

=== Prerequisites

For this example, it is assumed that ServiceMix, Java and Maven are installed locally on your machine. Further, it is assumed that
ServiceMix is up and running.

=== ActiveMQ and ServiceMix Web Consoles

The ActiveMQ web console can be used to inspect and manage ActiveMQ configuration, queues and topics. If ServiceMix is running
locally, the console can be accessed at http://localhost:8181/activemqweb/.

If the ActiveMQ web console has not been installed previously, install the feature from the Karaf console:

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:install activemq-web-console
---- 

Note that the ServiceMix console is accessible at http://localhost:8181/system/console/, with default username smx, and password smx.
This feature can be installed from the Karaf console using

[source,text]
----
karaf@root>feature:install webconsole
---- 
 
Inspect the ActiveMQ web console before running the example. Note that initially, there are no queues defined.  

=== Blueprint Example Explained

The following Blueprint XML-file is based on the example included in the ServiceMix distribution. Configuration related to the
custom transformation bean and handling of persistent properties have been removed for simplicity.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<blueprint
    xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
    xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd">

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <route>
            <from uri="timer://myTimer?fixedRate=true&amp;period=2000" /> <!--1-->
            <bean ref="myTransform" method="transform"/> <!--2--> <!--7-->
            <to uri="activemq:queue:LOG.ME" /> <!--3-->
        </route>
        <route>
            <from uri="activemq:queue:LOG.ME" /> <!--4-->
            <to uri="log:ExampleActiveMQRouterBlueprint" /> <!--5-->
        </route>
    </camelContext>

    <cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="org.apache.servicemix.examples"> <!--6-->
        <cm:default-properties>
            <cm:property name="prefix" value="ActiveMQ-Blueprint-Example"/>
        </cm:default-properties>
    </cm:property-placeholder>

    <bean id="myTransform" class="org.apache.servicemix.examples.activemq.MyTransform"> <!--7-->
        <property name="prefix" value="${prefix}" />
    </bean>

</blueprint>
----
<1> A Camel timer endpoint generates a heartbeat event every 2000ms, generating a new message.
<2> The timer message is transformed by the _transform_ method of the bean referenced by _myTransform_.
<3> The message is sent to the LOG.ME queue on the ActiveMQ broker. This queue is created automatically.
<4> The message is consumed from the LOG.ME queue on the ActiveMQ broker.
<5> A Camel log endpoint sends the message to the Jakarta commons logger. By default, the log is written to
_c:\bin\apache-servicemix-7.0.0\data\log\servicemix.log.
<6> The persistent property _prefix_ has a default value of _ActiveMQ-Blueprint-Example_ and can be configured in the file
_org.apache.servicemix.examples.cfg_ if desired.
<7> The bean _myTransform_ references the class _org.apache.servicemix.examples.activemq.MyTransform_. This class has one
configurable property, _prefix_. The expression _${prefix}_ links it to the corresponding persistent cm:property.  

The class _org.apache.servicemix.examples.activemq.MyTransform_ transforms the message, using the _prefix_, some text and
the current date. It writes to both a logger and System.out. 

=== Building, Running, and Modifying the Example

Open a command window and navigate to the example directory, e.g. _c:\bin\apache-servicemix-7.0.0\examples\activemq\activemq-camel-blueprint\_.

WARNING: If you are using ServiceMix 7.0.0 download the pom.xml-file from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SM-3225 and replace the
pom.xml-file in the examples folder of the distribution with this.

Build the bundle by executing `mvn clean install`. After a successfull build, install the bundle from the Karaf console using

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:install examples-activemq-camel-blueprint
----

Almost immediately, log messages begin to appear in the Karaf console. 

Open the ActiveMQ web console at http://localhost:8181/activemqweb/ and inspect the Queues: the queue _LOG.ME_ has automatically
been created.

Edit the class _MyTransform_ and set `verbose=false;` to suppress the messages written to the Karaf console. Rebuild the bundle, and
reinstall it. Note that the bundle needs to be uninstalled before it can be re-installed:

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> feature:uninstall examples-activemq-camel-blueprint
karaf@root> feature:install examples-activemq-camel-blueprint
----

TIP: The relation between the feature name, _examples-activemq-camel-blueprint_, and the Maven artifact coordinates is defined in
the file _servicemix-examples-7.0.0-features.xml_ in the ServiceMix distribution.
