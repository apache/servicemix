=== Deploy as a plain Blueprint XML file

ServiceMix supports the deployment of plain Blueprint XML files, automatically creating and starting the Blueprint container from
the XML file.

In order to leverage this feature to create and start Camel routes, drop a file with this syntax in the _$SERVICEMIX_HOME/deploy_
folder:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
include::plain-blueprint-template.xml[]
----

==== Example

Create a new XML file, plain-blueprint.xml, in the deployment folder with the code below to start a route to copy files from one
directory to another.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
include::plain-blueprint.xml[]
----

Verify in the Karaf console that it has been started:

[source,text]
----
karaf@root> bundle:list | grep plain-blueprint
223 | Active   |  80 | 0.0.0                              | plain-blueprint.xml
karaf@root>
----

Copy a file into the folder _$SERVICEMIX_HOME/input_, and verify that it is copied to the folder _$SERVICEMIX_HOME/output_. Note
that the original file has been moved to the folder _$SERVICEMIX_HOME/input/.camel_.
