== Introduction

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful Bean
Integration.

=== Camel in ServiceMix

In ServiceMix, Apache Camel is like our swiss army knife for creating integration solutions.  It allows using XML or a
Java/Scala-based DSL to express your routes, comes with almost 200 optional components, has powerful and versatile Java bean
integration, error handling, and tons of other features.

Apache Camel is installed by default if you first start the container.  We also have out-of-the-box hot-deployment support for both
Spring and Blueprint to make it easy to deploy your own Camel routes, as well as optionally installable features for all the
available Camel components.

=== Goal of this guide

The goal of this guide is to look into the details for using Camel inside ServiceMix:

* deployment options
* installing additional components

=== Examples

The Apache ServiceMix distribution also contain a set of Camel examples.  You can find these examples in the _examples/camel_
directory.

=== More information about Camel

More information about Camel itself can be found on http://camel.apache.org.

There's also a great book available about Camel. Its second edition is planned to be published in July 2017:

Second Edition]_. Manning Publications. ISBN: 9781617292934.
