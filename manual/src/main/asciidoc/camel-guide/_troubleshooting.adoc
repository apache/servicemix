== Troubleshooting

In this section, you'll find solutions for some frequently asked questions when using Camel on ServicMix.

=== No component with id 'xyz' could be found
This usually means that your route is trying to use a component that hasn't been installed yet.

Solution:

. install the additional component
. restart the bundle using the _bundle:restart <bundle id>_ command - you can find the bundle id for your route in the output of the _bundle:list_ command

Refer to <<camel-installing,Installing additional components>>
