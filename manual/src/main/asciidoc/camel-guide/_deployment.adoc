== Deployment Options

There are a few different ways to deploy Camel routes on ServiceMix:

* deploy routes in a plain Blueprint XML file
* deploy routes in a plain Spring XML file
* deploy a bundle containing a Blueprint XML file
* deploy a bundle containing a Spring XML file

=== Benefits and drawbacks

==== Plain XML or OSGi bundles

Choose a plain XML file:

* if you want to get routes deployed as quickly as possible. +
  All you need for developing routes is a simple text editor, no compilation and building is required.
* if you prefer the XML syntax over the Java of Scala DSL.

Choose an OSGi bundle:

* if you want to package helper classes together with your route definitions.
* if you prefer developing routes in the Java or Scala DSL. +
    The RouteBuilder implementations can be packaged inside the bundle.

==== Blueprint or Spring

Choose Blueprint if you want the best possible integration with the OSGi Framework and Service Registy. The Blueprint specification
has been developed specifically for the OSGi Framework by the OSGi Alliance.

Choose Spring if you already invested in Spring for creating and running Camel routes.
