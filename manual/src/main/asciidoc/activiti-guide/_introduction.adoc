== Introducing Activiti

Activiti is a BPMN 2.0 process-engine framework that implements the BPMN 2.0 specification. It's able to  perform BPMN 2.0 functions
including deploy process definitions, start new process instances, and execute user tasks. Its core is a super-fast and rock-solid
BPMN 2 process engine for Java.


=== Activiti Engine

This is the heart of the Activiti project.  It's a Java process engine that runs BPMN 2 processes natively.  It will have the
following key properties:

* Allows user updates to be combined with process updates in a single transaction
* Runs on any Java environment like Spring, JTA, standalone with any form of transaction demarcation
* Easy to get up and running with the setup utility
* Built to support the cloud scalability from the ground up
* Very simple to add new custom activity types and complete dedicated process languages
* Transactional timers
* Asynchronous continuations
* Hidden event listeners for decoupling software technical details from business level diagram
* Ability to test process executions in isolation in a plain unit test

== Goal of this guide

The goal of this guide is to look into the details for using Activiti inside ServiceMix:

* create a project
* write and debug a simple process

== Examples

The Apache ServiceMix distributions also contains an Activiti example.  You can find this example in the _examples/activiti_ directory.
